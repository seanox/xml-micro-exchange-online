    <h1>Seanox XMEX - XML-Micro-Exchange (Free Web Service)</h1>
    <p>
      The origin of the project is the desire for an easily accessible place for
      data exchange on the Internet. Inspired by JSON-Storages the idea of a
      feature-rich equivalent based on XML, XPath and XSLT was born. The focus
      should be on a public, volatile and short-term data exchange for (static)
      web-applications and IoT.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Just exchange data without an own server landscape.<br/>
        Just exchange data without knowing and managing all clients.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      XML-Micro-Exchange is a volatile NoSQL stateless micro datasource for the
      Internet. It is designed for easy communication and data exchange of
      web-applications and for IoT or for other Internet-based modules and
      components. The XML based datasource is volatile and lives through
      continuous use and expires through inactivity. They are designed for
      active and near real-time data exchange but not as a real-time capable
      long-term storage. Compared to a JSON storage, this datasource supports
      more dynamics, partial data access, data transformation, and volatile
      short-term storage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Why all this?</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Static web-applications on different clients want to communicate with
        each other, e.g. for games, chats and collaboration.
      </li>
      <li>
        Smart sensors want to share their data and smart devices want to access
        this data and also exchange data with each other.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clients can establish dynamically volatile networks.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>
        In this communication are all participants.<br/>
        No one is a server or master, all are equal and no one has to know the other.<br/>
        All meet without obligation.
      </strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>RESTful</strong><br>
        The REST API supports the HTTP methods CONNECT, OPTIONS, GET, POST, PUT,
        PATCH, DELETE. The CONNECT method is not a standard and the function can
        be used alternatively via TOUCH or PUT without XPath.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>XPath</strong><br>
        XPath axes and functions are used for access, navigation and addressing
        of targets in the data source and it is an integral part of the URI with
        dynamic and functional effects.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Multiple axes and targets</strong><br>
        An XPath axis can address several elements and attributes
        simultaneously, which can be changed with one call.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>XPath Functions</strong><br>
        PUT and PATCH support XML structures and static values (text), as well
        as XPath functions that allow dynamic values.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Data Query</strong><br>
        Data can be queried in the form of XML structure or substructure if the
        XPath notation represents an axis, otherwise the XPath is interpreted as
        an XPath function and responded with the result as text. Thus XPath
        provides a dynamic syntax for queries.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Data Transformation</strong><br>
        The POST method supports data transformation via XSLT. Similar to GET,
        data can be queried and then transformed with an XSLT template
        transmitted via POST.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>JSON Support</strong><br>
        All requests can be responded by the service in JSON format.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Security</strong><br>
        This aspect was deliberately considered and implemented here only in a
        very rudimentary form. The storage name with a length of 1 - 64
        characters and the individual root element can be regarded as secret.
        For further security the approach of Basic Authentication, Digest Access
        Authentication and/or Server/Client certificates is followed, which is
        configured outside of the XMEX (XML-Micro-Exchange) at the web server.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>API</h3>
    <p>
      HTTP is used. The URI typically contains a noticeable separator to divide
      it into context path and XPath. For the API only the XPath is relevant.
    </p>
    <pre>
https://xmex.seanox.com/xmex!xpath(-function)
<-------------------------->|<-------------->
        Context Path              XPath
    </pre>
    <p>
      In some cases, the XPath syntax may not be supported as a URI by the
      client or provider. In these cases, the XPath can alternatively be used as
      Base64 or hexadecimal encoded. For this purpose, a question mark is
      expected after the last character of the context path and then the encoded
      string. The encoding method is determined automatically.
    </p>
    <pre>
https://xmex.seanox.com/xmex!count(//items[@id<0])
https://xmex.seanox.com/xmex!count(%2F%2Fitems[@id<0])
https://xmex.seanox.com/xmex!?636F756E74282F2F6974656D735B4069643C305D29
https://xmex.seanox.com/xmex!?Y291bnQoLy9pdGVtc1tAaWQ8MF0p
    </pre>
    <p>
      If the method cannot be determined, the string is interpreted as an XPath
      (function) and because of the question mark at the beginning usually
      causes an invalid XPath error.
    </p>
    <p>
      The request supports the following additional headers:
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Request Header</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><code>Storage</code></td>
          <td>Storage identifier optional with name of the root element</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      Also the response has additional headers:
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Response Header</th>
          <th>Description</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><code>Storage</code></td>
          <td>Storage identifier without the name of the root element</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>Storage-Revision</code></td>
          <td>Current revision of the storage (revision/changes)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>Storage-Space</code></td>
          <td>Capacity of the storage (total/used in bytes)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>Storage-Last-Modified</code></td>
          <td>Timestamp (RFC822) of the last access</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>Storage-Expiration</code></td>
          <td>Timestamp (RFC822) when the storage will expire</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>Storage-Expiration-Time</code></td>
          <td>Idle time in milliseconds until storage expires</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>Execution-Time</code></td>
          <td>Duration of request processing in milliseconds</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>Error</code></td>
          <td>Unique error number from the logging with status 500</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>Message</code></td>
          <td>Detailed error message with status 400 / 422</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Notice about response code 404: This always refers to the storage file,
        but never to an addressed target in the storage. If a target does not
        exist, requests are responded to with code 204 or 304 for modifying
        requests.
      </strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          The storage must be opened by CONNECT, TOUCH or PUT without XPath.
          This can be done by any client, even if the storage already exists.
          Because CONNECT and TOUCH are not an HTTP standard, it is better to
          use PUT without XPath.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The client should always proceed as if it were using storage alone
          and created the schema it needs. The creation of the schema is done
          with PUT. Relative and conditional axes should be used as targets.
          This ensures that no duplicates are created or data is overwritten.
        </p>
        <p>
          e.g. <code>PUT /books[not(book[@title='A Modern Utopia'])]::last</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach made transactions unnecessary.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Now the client can use the storage.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Closing or terminating the storage is not possible and necessary. The
          storage expires automatically due to inactivity. The duration of use
          and expiration time of the storage is contained in the response in the
          headers <code>Storage-Last-Modified</code>,
          <code>Storage-Expiration</code>, <code>Storage-Expiration-Time</code>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
